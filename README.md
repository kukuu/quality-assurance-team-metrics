# Quality Assurance & Team Metrics
Quality Assurance is a set of activities and processes designed to ensure that a product or service meets specific quality requirements and standards. QA is an integral part of the software development lifecycle and is focused on preventing defects and ensuring that the final product meets customer expectations.

The choice of tools depends on specific project requirements, budget, and the testing approach followed by the organization. It's essential to evaluate and select tools that best fit your team's needs and provide the necessary support for efficient and effective QA processes.

QA is typically performed by dedicated quality assurance teams or individuals who are responsible for overseeing and implementing QA processes. They work closely with developers, testers, and other stakeholders to ensure that quality is built into the software from the early stages of development.

It's important to note that QA is distinct from Quality Control (QC), which involves the actual testing and verification of the product or service. While QA focuses on prevention and process improvement, QC focuses on detection and correction of defects through testing and inspection.

Together, QA and QC activities contribute to ensuring that the final product or service meets the desired level of quality, reliability, and customer satisfaction.


# Team Metrics & Continuous Improvement

Using data and metrics to guide technical decisions and improve team performance

_Scenario:_

At Marks & Spencer, I noticed that the team was spending too much time on manual testing, which was slowing down releases and  needed to improve the efficiency of the testing process without compromising quality.

_Action:_ I introduced automated testing frameworks like Jest and Cypress and set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. I also tracked metrics like test coverage, defect density, and mean time to recovery (MTTR) to measure progress.

_Result:_ Test coverage increased from 60% to 90%, and the time to release new features was reduced by 50%.

..furter Metrics
Technical Metrics:

i. Code Quality: Code coverage percentage via automated tests (benchmark: >80% coverage).

ii. Number of code reviews completed and time spent on reviews.

iii. Number of critical bugs identified in production (benchmark: minimal or zero).

Delivery Metrics: i. Time taken to complete user stories or tickets (Cycle Time and Lead Time). Adherence to sprint timelines and delivery commitments.

System Performance Metrics: i. Response time and latency of backend services (benchmark: under 200ms for most APIs). ii. Uptime percentage of systems (benchmark: >99.9% uptime).

Bug Resolution: i. Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) critical incidents (benchmark: < 1 hour for P1 issues).

ii. Defect rate per feature released.

iii. Automation Coverage: Percentage of tasks automated (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, deployment processes).

Team Productivity and Collaboration iv. Velocity: Number of story points or tickets completed per sprint.

v. Pull Request Metrics: Average time to merge a PR (benchmark: <2 days).

vi. Number of reviews per PR (benchmark: minimum 2).

vii. Knowledge Sharing: Number of team-wide documentation contributions. Regularity of knowledge-sharing sessions (e.g., tech talks or retrospectives).

viii. On-call Effectiveness: On-call rotationsâ€™ effectiveness in resolving incidents (percentage of escalations handled within SLA).

ix. Individual Performance

a. Contribution to team goals (e.g., tickets closed, quality of deliverables).

b. Initiative in problem-solving or suggesting optimizations.

c. Mentorship activities for junior engineers.

d. Consistency in meeting deadlines and commitments.

x. Team Satisfaction and Retention

a. Employee satisfaction surveys (benchmark: average score >4/5).

b. Attrition rate (benchmark: <10% annually).

c. Participation in team events, discussions, and retrospectives.
